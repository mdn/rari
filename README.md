# Welcome to `rari`

`rari` is the build system for [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org).

`rari` is hosted by [MDN](https://github.com/mdn).

## Getting Started

To get up and running, follow these steps:

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed, otherwise go to [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/).

Clone this repository and run:
```plain
cargo run -- --help
```

### Configuation

Create a `.config.toml` in the current working directory.
Add the following:

```toml
content_root = "/<ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO-mdn/content>/files"
build_out_root = "/tmp/rari"
```

## Contributing

For now we're aiming for a parity rewrite of [yari's](https://github.com/mdn/yari) `yarn build -n`. Which generates the `index.json`
for all docs. Until we reach that point the codebase will be unstable and may change at any point. Therefore we won't accept contributions for now.
